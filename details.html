      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <article>
      <p></p>The promotion of healthy living, specifically with exercise and diets, is very prevalent especially in this digital age, 
      but what about the promotion of social well-being?
      <p>Our solution for this problem is to create a progressive application that will promote a healthy lifestyle to the youth. 
      This project will not only check on your daily exercise and eating habits, but also your social well-being. To do this, the 
      application will have daily check-in notifications along with the implementation of games to increase audience engagement and 
      participation. The outcome we hope to achieve is for our users to live a healthy life with the feeling of satisfaction. </p>
      <p>The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor, 
      in the form of a <a href="https://ceias.nau.edu/cs/CS_Capstone/Projects/F24/5.F24_TESLNAU_Kang.pdf">Capstone project proposal</a>. </p>

      <h2>High-level requirements</h2>
      <article>
      <p>Users will respond to daily survey prompts concerning their physical, mental, and social health through a multiple-choice scale.</p>
      <p>Bee Balanced will provide personalized feedback to users, helping them identify their health habits that can be improved.</p>
      <p>Users will earn rewards as they make improvements to their health habits over time. </p>
      <p>Users can set their preferred time for receiving notifications to take their health survey prompts, allowing them to take the surveys
      based around their personal schedule. </p>
      </article>

      <h2>Envisioned Solution</h2>
      <article>
      <p>Bee Balanced will be a web application, targeted to students, to analyze patterns in health
      habits. The website will be designed to be used on either mobile or desktop devices, flexible for any type of user. Users will be able to make a 
      personal account to hold all of their information and will be prompted daily to answer a list of survey questions pertaining to their current health.
      Bee Balanced will give the user tasks based on their recorded responses, helping them improve their present health concerns. Upon completing these tasks,
      users will gain points and earn rewards based on the amount of overall progress they have made. Bee Balanced will incorporate a scheduling system based on
      the user's time preferences and will send notifications to complete the given survey for the day. The overall goal of this system is to collect data on
      adolescents' health and help those users better their health, while making it a fun interactive experience to keep users motivated.</p>
